    <b>Below is all the information you will need to play the game</b><br/>
   <b>Attack:</b> This stat is the players combat strength and overall strength, used in combat and to complete strength based tasks. (Attack stat = 6 + roll)<br/>
    <b>Health:</b> This is a players health points, when this reaches 0 the game is over. (Health stat = 12 + roll + roll)<br/>
    <b>Luck:</b> Used in situations that require luck, when these situations occur, roll both the dice, if the sum of both dice is equal to or lower than your current luck stat you have been lucky, if the sum is higher then you are unlucky. On the completion of a succesful luck situation your current luck stat will reduce by 1(you can't always be lucky!). (Luck stat = 6 + roll)<br/>
    <b>Skill:</b> The skill stat decides what weapons you can use and can help a player through skill based situations. (Skill stat = roll + roll)<br/>
    <b>Combat:</b> Combat will be frequent throughout this game, when placed in a combat situation it plays out similarly almost everytime(Unless specific changes are stated in the combat dialogue or different items are used). Combat starts when a player chooses to fight an enemy, <u>First</u>, the player rolls both dice, this is added onto their attack stat and they submit their score, <u>Second</u>, the player rolls both die, this is added onto the enemies attack stat and they submit the enemies score. The player with the higher attack wins the round and the loser deducts two points from their health. If the attack of both players are equal they both lose 2 points of health. Combat ends when one of the playes health reaches 0.<br/>
    <b>Notepad:</b> Found in the bottom left corner, this helpful tool allows you to take notes as you play to remember helpful tips you may be given. <br/>
    Give it a try! Press the notepad button and type in the input bar 'Don't trust the squirrel!'.<br/>
    <b>Map:</b> Found in the bottom left corner, this button will take you to 'Sketch.io' where you can draw and save a map so you can keep track of where you have been for future playthroughs.<br/>
    <b>Backpack:</b> Found in the bottom left corner, where all obtainable items are stored.<br/>
    <b>Stats:</b> Found in the bottom right corner, this tab keeps track of your current player stats. Watch that health!<br/>
    <b>Rations/Potions/Gold:</b> These are found in the top right corner and these are called active items. <u>Rations</u> can only be eaten outside of combat and restore 2 health, if cooked they can restore 3 health. <u>Potions</u>can only be used in combat and they restore 5 health. <u>Gold</u> is used to buy items in shops.<br/>
    <b>Dice:</b>The dice are used frequently throughout the story and will always be found in the top left corner, you roll the dice then type your outcome into the input fields(if a player wishes to cheat they ruin the experience by their own choice, we get it, you're bad at the game kid!). <br/>
