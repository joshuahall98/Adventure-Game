	<h1>Story Background</h1>

	<p>At the base of a giant mountain, surrounded by forest and fields, in the country of Vanyeuor, stands a small village, it is here where our story begins. Three days ago news reached the village that the whereabouts of the crypt that held the Lost King's Sword had been found, but not the sword itself. Legend says that the wielder of the sword will be given the power to rule over the land, the power of the old Kings. The sword was lost over three hundred years ago and since then no king has ruled over Vanyeuor, the lands have become a dangerous place and are overun with villainous beings who are exploiting those of lesser power than they. If they were to get their hands on the sword a new era of evil would commence...</p>

	Our protagonist in this story is a young human by the name of <span id="PlayerName"></span>, who only recently reached adulthood. Their great grandfather used to tell them stories from when they were a child, about the times when kings ruled. When are young protagonist heard the news about the sword, they decided they were going to be the one to bring back the old ways. It took them three days to plan their trip, to pack all their essentials (Rations , Flint, Wood Cutter's Axe, Spare Clothes and a purse full of gold <u>*Items will be stored in your backpack when you continue*</u>) and to say goodbye to family and friends, because their return was unlikely. Before they set out their great grandfather bestowed upon them a gift he believed would help them on their journey. It was a backpack he had won from a bet with a travelling merchant, the bag was a prized possession of his because it was imbued with magic, making the bag weightless and seemingly bottomless. Ready to set out on their adventure they stood on the edge of the village, it is here that YOU the player take control of this story...
