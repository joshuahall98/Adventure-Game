    <h1>Follow the Squirrel</h1>

    <p>Your curiosity gets the better of you and decide to follow the strange creature. The squirrel jumps through the bush it came from and you push through and follow. The squirrel is fast and you struggle to keep up with it, every so often you lose sight of it but after a quick scan of the forest surroundings you spot a bushy tail bouncing through the undergrowth. You follow the the squirrel deeper into the forest straying further from your normal route til eventually it stops. You find yourself in a small glade. the squirrel is looking up at you with those same strange eyes. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a group of squirrels comes running out from the undergrowth, you are surrounded. You aren't even given time to question how weird this situation is when all the squirrels jump at you biting and scratching you all over. You try to throw them off but there's too many on you (<u>*You lose 2 points of health*</u>). As fast as the mayhem started it abruptly stops, the squirrels stop attacking and run off across the glade. You look to where the squirrels went and see a man standing there, surrounded by the squirrels and holding a pouch, YOUR POUCH. The man smirks at you then turns and flees with all your gold, the squirrels following. You don't even try to pursue him, you realise you're not going to beat this squirrel man. Embarrased and defeated you head back the way you came.<br/>
    It doesn't take long for you to find your way back and after a short walk in the right direction you find yourself at the edge of the forest, staring at the neighbouring village. </p>
